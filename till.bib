Abstract = {{The C-C bond distance in molecular benzene is used by several electron
   diffraction groups to calibrate the electron wavelength in a gas
   electron diffraction experiment. It is therefore important to compare
   the applied r(a) value against the currently best available ab initio
   r(e) result. A high level CCSD(T = Full)/cc-pVTZ calculation, which has
   proven to give r(e) distances close to the experimental values, gave
   r(e)(C-C) = 1.392 angstrom. When our wavelength calibration distance
   r(a)(C-C) = 1.3975 angstrom is corrected for atomic displacements in
   the curvilinear approach and for anharmonic vibrations, it matches
   exactly the calculated r(e)(C-C) value. From a B3LYP/cc-pVTZ molecular
   force field the distance correction terms (d(hn)) and the
   root-mean-square vibration amplitudes were computed both in the linear
   and the curvilinear approximations.
   Gas electron diffraction intensities for benzene were registered on
   Fuji imaging plates. The data are very reproducible and revealed that
   systematic discrepancies might be present. A method to investigate
   systematic errors in electron diffraction is proposed. A multiplicative
   correction likely due to very small errors in the applied sector
   correction could be estimated. Applying this new correction the
   agreement is improved due to the high reproducibility of the imaging
   plates, however, hardly all systematic errors are removed. The
   agreement is very good and the errors left are unlikely to be caused by
   the Fuji imaging plate system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights
